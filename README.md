Portfolio Slideshow

Here is my portfolio slideshow showing a few projects I've worked on. These range from testing fixtures, to machining fixtures. The last photo is a sheetmetal bracket I designed for an energy storage system retrofit kit (please excuse stains on thw metal, it got stained during the testing).
